# UCI Adult Income Dataset - Practice Project


### Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Adult Income Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on census data. This project serves as practice to enhance my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms implementation.

The dataset, also known as the Census Income Dataset, contains demographic and employment information, extracted from the 1994 U.S. Census database. The task involves building classification models to predict the income category.

### Dataset Information
- Subject Area: Social Science
- Associated Task: Classification
- Dataset Characteristics: Multivariate
- Feature Types: Categorical, Integer
- Number of Instances: 48,842
- Number of Features: 14 (excluding target)
- Contains Missing Values: Yes

#### Extraction Information
The dataset was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census Database. The records were cleaned using the following conditions:
* (Age > 16) && (Adjusted Gross Income > 100) && (Final Weight > 1) && (Hours Worked per Week > 0)

#### Prediction Task
The goal is to determine whether an individual's annual income is greater than $50,000 or less than or equal to $50,000.


### Project Objective
The main goal of this project is practice. It is intended to:
-    Explore and analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights.
-    Visualize key relationships between variables.
-    Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict income.
-    Practice handling missing data and cleaning data as required.
This project will not be used for academic publications or professional presentations. Itâ€™s purely for self-improvement purposes.


### Features
Here is a breakdown of the dataset's features:

# Handling Missing Values
The dataset contains missing values in the following columns:
-    workclass
-    occupation
-    native-country
A common approach to handle these missing values would be imputation, removal of rows, or using algorithms capable of handling missing data. These techniques will be explored as part of the project.
